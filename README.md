# Stock Prediction Model #
In this project, We designed and implemented a machine learning model for predicting the future value of stocks based on historical price data and market indicators. 

## Dataset Details ##
Yahoo Finance - We used Yahoo Finance's dataset and the YFinance Python library for stock data. The dataset provides open, high, low, and close prices of every trade day for major listings on Nasdaq. We divided the dataset into train (65%) and test (35%) sets for predicting stock values.

## Proposed Architecture ##
We used TensorFlow's Sequential Model with LSTM and Dense layers for stock prediction, focussing on Apple and Microsoft stocks.

## Method ##
- Employed machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decisions trees, and neural networks to build the stock prediction model. 
- Incorporated features derived from historical price data and technical indicators as input variables.
- Trained the model on historical stock data and evaluated its performance using appropriate metrics. 

## Results ##
- LSTM demonstrated good regression capability for stock prediction.
- Future predictions showed fluctuations, but overall effectiveness in capturing trends.
- LSTM proved effective in capturing stock trends based on historical data.
